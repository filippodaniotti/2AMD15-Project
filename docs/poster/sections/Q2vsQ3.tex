\begin{block}{Question 2 vs. Question 3}
    Both solution produced the \textbf{same results}:

        \input{../assets/tables/q2_vs_q3.tex}
    \end{table}
    % Tests were performed running the code of Question 3 on the data generated for Question 2.  Even though the differences in the implementation of Q3 are not so trivial the main differences are as follows:
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item A different use of the \mintinline{python}{.coalesce()} and \mintinline{python}{.repartition()}
    %     \item A different number of queries. Q3 only queries two values (\(\tau \le 20\) and \(\tau \le 410\)) compared to 5 for Q2.
    %     \item The \mintinline{python}{DataFrame} API of Spark SQL might be inherently slower than the usage of plain Spark.
    % \end{itemize}
