TODO:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Read carefully through the report (correct mistakes, make sure that there is everything that is supposed to be there according to the instructions)
    \item Read thoroughly through the Q4 (description of how are we utilizing sketch, proof, and discussion of results).
    \item writes a sentence about an explanation of how a user should choose the correct parameters for the sketch to achieve the guarantees (there is a todo note in Q4).
    \item writes a short paragraph about the tightness of the bounds (there is a todo note in Q4).
    \item write one line introduction (that this file is a report for assignment from the 2AMD15 course)
    \item fill the poster with tables, figures, diagrams, and math from the report. bullet points to explain staff. no structured phrases, just keywords or at most short sentences
    \item think about Q5 and add it to the poster. this may require more structured text
    \item Fill in a contribution table, detailing the contribution of each team member (approximate percentage of work per member, and what each one did).
